This repo contains my solutions to the ML problems on [deep-ml.com](https://www.deep-ml.com/).

## Status
[![Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/brentspell/deep-ml-solutions/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/brentspell/deep-ml-solutions?branch=main)

## Development

### Setup
The following script creates a virtual environment using
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for the project and installs
dependencies with [uv](https://pypi.org/project/uv/).

```bash
pyenv install 3.12
pyenv virtualenv 3.12 deep-ml
bin/deps
```

You can also use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) with the project to
run tests, etc. at commit time.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Testing
Testing, formatting, and static checking can all be done with pre-commit at
any time.

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

There is also a watcher script that can be used to run these whenever a file
changes.

```bash
bin/watch
```
